Windows setup & build guide for SuperClawBot

Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit recommended)
- Python 3.8+ (64-bit) installed and on PATH
- Git (optional, to clone the repo)
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (install if the app fails to start)
- Optional: a clean Windows VM for testing

Quick setup (run in PowerShell from repository root)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

2. Upgrade packaging tools and install runtime requirements
   pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install PyInstaller for building
   pip install pyinstaller

4. (Optional) If `tflite-runtime` fails to install on your platform, install
   `tensorflow` or use an alternative runtime compatible with Windows.

Build the app (one-folder for debugging)
 - Run the included helper script:
   .\scripts\build_windows.ps1

 - Or run PyInstaller manually (example):
   python -m PyInstaller --noconfirm --onedir --name SuperClawBot \
     --add-data "resources;resources" --add-data "models;models" --collect-all PySide6 main.py

Notes & troubleshooting
- The produced folder lives in `dist\SuperClawBot`. Run the EXE inside to test.
- If Qt plugins are missing, add `--collect-all PySide6` or explicitly add binaries.
- Large model files will increase bundle size; consider shipping them separately
  and downloading on first run to reduce build size.
- If Bluetooth/serial access fails, ensure Windows drivers are installed and
  update `config.py` to point to the correct `COM` port (e.g. `COM3`).
- End users typically don't need Python; the PyInstaller bundle includes it.
  They may still need the VC++ redistributable and drivers.

Recommended final steps
- Test the built app on a clean Windows VM and note any missing DLLs/plugins.
- Package `dist\SuperClawBot` into a .zip or installer and upload to Releases.
- Do NOT commit your `.venv` or `dist` into git; add them to `.gitignore`.

If you want, I can update `scripts\build_windows.ps1` to include exact
`--add-data` entries for every resource/model file in the repo (I can list
their sizes first to help estimate final bundle size).
